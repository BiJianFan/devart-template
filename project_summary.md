## Description
Celestial Messenger is a dragon sculpture enbedded with a message encrypted in binary code.  The code is generated by light obstruction (0) and transmission (1) through pinholes on dragon's body, a visual sketch is provided in the link below.  It is inspired by dragon's mystery and extraterrestrial intelligence.   It incorporates mobile communication technology into the dragon sculpture such as Near Field Communication (NFC) and links the dragon sculpture through mobile devices (smartphones and tablets etc.) to a website for cracking the code.

Viewers could read the binary codes on the dragon, input them into the converion website and receive the textual translation. The participatory art fosters integration of technology and art in education.
