# Project Title
Celestial Messenger

## Description
Celestial Messenger is a dragon sculpture encrypted with a celestial message in binary code.  The code is generated by light obstruction (0) and transmission (1) through pinholes on dragon's body, a visual demonstration is provided in the link below.  It is inspired by dragon's mystery and extraterrestrial intelligence.   I'd like to incorporate mobile communication technology into the dragon sculpture such as Near Field Communication (NFC) or iBeacon through mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.).  It links the dragon sculpture online to a website for cracking the code.
Viewers could read and input the binary codes on the dragon and the website outputs the textual translation.   The participatory art can also add sound a visual art to enhance art experience or create a perceptive illustion for artistic gain.
